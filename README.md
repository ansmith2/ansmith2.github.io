# About me
  
## My interests

   Hello everyone, my name is Amanda Smith. I enjoy hiking, playing video games, going to the beach and a lot of other things! I really take up a bunch of different stuff, I guess you could call me a jack of all trades. One thing that I really enjoy is being on the *PERT Team* at my job. Which is the *Prison Emergency Response Team* for the Department of Adult Corrections. We do interesting missions, like being activated for prison escapes as well as assisting with missing people and riots. 

   My academic interest right now is Cyber Security. I would like to be able to obtain a job with the State in cyber security so that I can take my time and my benefits with me. 


## Websites I Recommend

   - [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com) � Here you can find what�s trending, quizzes, breaking news and a bunch of different food videos. I find this interesting because there is always something new to learn!

   - [Wordle]( https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle) � Wordle is just plain fun, each day you have 6 tries to guess the 5 letter word of the day. You can also navigate other games on the _New York Times_ website.
